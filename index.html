      <p>Dear readers, these Java Interview Questions have been
        designed especially to get you acquainted with the nature
        of questions you may encounter during your interview for
        the subject of Java Programming Language. As per my experience,
        good interviewers hardly planned to ask any particular question
        during your interview, normally questions start with some basic
        concept of the subject and later they continue based on further
        discussion and what you answer.</p>

            Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS,

        <h3>
          Classes and Objects in Java.
        </h3>
        <lu>
          <li>
            <b>Object</b> &#8209; Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name,
            breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance
            of a class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Class</b> &#8209; A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
          </li>

        <h3>
          Java Constructors
        </h3>
        <p>
          A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as
          its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have
          no explicit return type.
