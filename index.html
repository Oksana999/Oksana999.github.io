      <p>Dear readers, these Java Interview Questions have been
        designed especially to get you acquainted with the nature
        of questions you may encounter during your interview for
        the subject of Java Programming Language. As per my experience,
        good interviewers hardly planned to ask any particular question
        during your interview, normally questions start with some basic
        concept of the subject and later they continue based on further
        discussion and what you answer &#95;</p>
